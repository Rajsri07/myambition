<P>I like to become an IAS OFFICER because an IAS is all India service. By choosing my career as an IAS officer, I can serve the society. It is an assured career with many perks and privileges. The job of an IAS officer is highly respectable and there is a great sense of satisfaction as I will be contributing to the society to the highest level.</P>
